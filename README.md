## Overview

The **Exam Manager** is an innovative application designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and generating exams. Developed using Java and JavaFX, this project adheres to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and employs the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. The application leverages advanced data structures to optimize the exam generation process, resulting in improved performance and scalability.

This project was developed as part of an advanced Java course, focusing on real-world applications of Java programming, including data structures, OOP, and MVC design patterns.
